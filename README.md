This repository contains a setup for deploying and configuring Suricata, a powerful, open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). It is designed to detect and analyze network threats in real-time.



Real-Time Packet Inspection: Suricata inspects network traffic to detect potential security threats.

Rule-Based Detection: Uses signature-based rules to identify malicious activity.

Custom Rule Creation: Modify and create custom detection rules for specific security policies.

Logging & Alerting: Logs detected threats and alerts security teams.

EICAR Test Integration: Uses the EICAR test file to verify IDS functionality.
